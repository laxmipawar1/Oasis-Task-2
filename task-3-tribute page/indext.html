        <h1 style="text-align:center; font: bold;color: red; font-size: 40px;"> ABOUT THE LEGEND</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font: bold;font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">

            
         <h1 style="color: green;"> Early life </h1>
         <p  style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font: bold; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">  Lata Mangeshkar was born on 28 September 1929 in a Maharashtrian Brahmin family the eldest daughter of Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi and his wife Shudhamati, a Gujarati[18] in Indore (in the present-day Indore district of Madhya Pradesh and then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India). Her father, Deenanath, was a classical singer and theatre actor. Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), a Gujarati woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra), was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died, was Shevanti's older sister.

            Her paternal grandfather, Ganesh Bhatt Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), was a married Karhade Brahmin pujari who performed the abhisheka of the Shiva lingam at the Mangueshi Temple in Goa. Her paternal grandmother, Yesubai Rane, was his Devadasi mistress from Goa. Since Deenanath Mangeshkar's parents were not married to each other, he did not inherit his father's caste and surname but instead inherited his mother's caste status. Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner. She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.
            
            Deenanath adopted the surname Mangeshkar in order to identify his family with his native town of Mangeshi, Goa. Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, भाव बंधन.
            
            She was the eldest child in the family. Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her siblings; all are accomplished singers and musicians.
            
            She received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On her first day of school,[24] Mangeshkar left because she was not allowed to bring her sister Asha along with her.    </p>
        <h1 style="color: green;"> Awards and recognition </h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font: bold; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">Mangeshkar won several awards and honours, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, Padma     Bhushan   (1969), Padma Vibhushan (1999), Zee Cine Award for Lifetime Achievements (1999), Dadasaheb Phalke Award (1989), Maharashtra Bhushan Award (1997),NTR National Award (1999), Bharat Ratna (2001), Legion of Honour (2007), ANR National Award (2009), three National Film Awards and 15 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards. She also won four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards. In 1969, she made the unusual gesture of giving up the Filmfare Best Female Playback Award in order to promote fresh talent. She was later awarded the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993 and Filmfare Special Awards in 1994 and 2004.

            In 1984, the State Government of Madhya Pradesh instituted the Lata Mangeshkar Award in her honour. The State Government of Maharashtra also instituted a Lata Mangeshkar Award in 1992.
            
            In 2009, she was awarded the title of Officer of the French Legion of Honour, France's highest order.
            
            In 2012, she was ranked number 10 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian since independence.
            
            Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan said kambakht, kabhi besuri na hoti ("[she] is never off-key"). Dilip Kumar once commented, Lata Mangeshkar ki awaaz kudrat ki takhleek ka ek karishma hain, meaning "Lata Mangeshkar's voice is a miracle from God".
            
            She also received honorary doctorates from the Sangeet Natak Akademi in 1989, Indira Kala Sangeet Vishwavidyalaya, Khairagarh, and Shivaji University in Kolhapur.

         <h1 style="color: green;"> Controversy</h1>
         <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font: bold; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">   In 1974, The Guinness Book of Records listed Lata Mangeshkar as the most recorded artist in history, stating that she had reportedly recorded "more than 25,000 solo, duet and chorus backed songs in 20 Indian languages" between 1948 and 1974. Her record was contested by Mohammad Rafi, who was claimed to have sung around 28,000 songs.[188][189] After Rafi's death, in its 1984 edition, the Guinness Book of World Records stated her name for the "Most Recordings", but also stated Rafi's claim. The later editions of Guinness Book stated that she had sung no fewer than 30,000 songs between 1948 and 1987.

            The entry was discontinued by Guinness editions in 1991 without explanation, while several sources continued to claim that she recorded thousands of songs, with estimates ranging up to figures as large as 50,000.[191][192] However, even the earliest Guinness claim of 25,000 songs (between 1948 and 1974) was disputed and claimed to have been exaggerated by several others, stating that the number of songs sung by her in Hindi films till 1991 was found to be 5025.Mangeshkar stated that she did not keep a record of the number of songs she recorded, and that she did not know from where Guinness Book editors got their information.[197] In 2011, the entry was revived by Guinness crediting the record to her sister Asha Bhosle as the most recorded artist in music history, "for recording up to 11,000 solo, duet and chorus-backed songs and in over 20 Indian languages since 1947". Since 2016, current record in this category belongs to P. Susheela, for recording at least 17,695 songs in 6 languages, not counting some lost early recordings.   </p>

            The Government of India announced a two-day period of national mourning and that the national flag will fly at half-mast from 6 to 7 February throughout India out of respect for her.[165] President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several Union Ministers and Chief Ministers,many members of the Indian Music Industry, Indian film industry, celebrities, fans, and netizens expressed their condolences.
